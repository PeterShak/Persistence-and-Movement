## Description of variables 
* r: used to store the color for the background (uses numbers from 0-255 as the color for RGB only goes from 0-255).
* g: used to store the color for the background (uses numbers from 0-255 as the color for RGB only goes from 0-255).
* b: used to store the color for the background (uses numbers from 0-255 as the color for RGB only goes from 0-255).
* Wide: this is a variable that uses numbers to create a loop of constantly moving the white circles - snow - down the page. The x (let tall) and y (let wide) coordinates start at a random value, but the y (let wide) coordinate increases (wide = wide+1) making the snow look like it's falling.
