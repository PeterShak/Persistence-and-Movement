# Persistence and Movement Reflection
One challenege I had was trying to figure remember how to make the scene I wanted play out over time. I forgot that you had to use the let function at the very top, so I got error 
messages saying that the variables weren't defined. After I realized that, I put the random number for r, g, and b in the same spot as well as the wide and tall, leading to error messages,
at which poit I remembered they had to go into the function setup(). However, I remembered that the wide = wide+1 had to go into the function draw() part, so I had no issues with that one.
It now makes more sense how the random() function works and how it can add another layer of depth to the sketch. I was somewhat lost on the meet we had earlier in the week, but after 
trying for myself I figured it all out. I am proud of making a somewhat complicated sketch and keeping the code clean and concise to the best of my ability.
